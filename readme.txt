Project Description 
Name: Price Comparator with Web-scraping 
Description: My project returns real-time price data about items based on their age, model, and other qualifiers, especially for items that are prone to depreciation. 
This data is extracted from web-scraping top sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. 
The value of this app is the ability to give information about the lowest, average, and highest prices for a specific item such as a 2016 13-inch Dell XPS that a user would otherwise have to collect by browsing multiple websites. 
Additional features include graphing depreciation of each item by comparing to data on previous, older models and displaying the changes in lowest, average, and highest prices. 
Hyperlinks are also implemented to show previews of webpage results and open the actual websites.
